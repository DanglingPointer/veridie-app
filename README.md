# VeriDie

Welcome to VeriDie, the most useless Android app ever! The only thing it does is throw dices (in other words, generating random numbers), peer to peer via bluetooth. In theory, it could be potentially used by people who play board games, tabletop games etc. In practice, it was just fun to implement the peer to peer communication :)

Multiple Android devices connect to each other via bluetooth, automatically negotiate who's going to generate results (like floor control but decentralized, without a server), then share with each other every request made by users and result generated by the negotiated generator. At any point in time only one participant is generating dice cast results. That generator is renegotiated after every 10th dice cast.

The app seems to work fine, but the GUI is very basic.
